#### Some Notes

- Do NOT follow a tutorial on how to write a specific game -- you're locking your architecture
- Follow a tutorial on how to write a feature, then adapt to your game

---

#### Code

- Remember and, importantly, **use** good practices
- Naming conventions
- Only valuable comments
- Short and simple classes / functions (_monadic_), but avoid contrived classes
- Make sure it works (test using GitHub pages and Uni PC) -- we won't fix it for you
- Structure your code **and** your assets

---

#### Report

- Clear structure
- Strong technical discussion
- Evidence of analysis
- Critique / reflection
- Concise -- long reports are a sign of poor preparation
- Avoid personal notes
- Don't leave till the last day -- bound to score low

---

#### Submission

- Directory structure on StudentCentral
- Follow the **instructions**, if incorrect format -- may not be accepted
- Don't submit files we didn't ask, e.g. mac OS hidden files, `.git` directory or assets you didn't use
- Don't wait till the last minute -- tech may break, aka 40% cap (*D-*)
- If you apply for an extension -- inform ASAP
