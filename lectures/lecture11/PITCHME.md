### Lecture 11 - Feedback Session and How to Submit

- Quick DOs and DON'Ts

---

#### Requirements

- C++
- Based on the CI628-PongClient demo provided + CI628-PongServer
- Submissions not based on the demo or C++ will not be accepted

- Report
- Video
- Re-check assignment brief

---

#### References

If not your work, **reference** it:

- _What_: asset / file name
- _Where_: link to where you got it from
- _How_: the license under which it's released

**There must be a sufficient amount of original work!**

---

#### Some Notes

- Do NOT follow a tutorial on how to write a specific game -- you're locking your architecture
- Follow a tutorial on how to write a feature, then adapt to your game

---

#### Code

- Remember and, importantly, **use** good practices
- Naming conventions
- Only valuable comments
- Short and simple classes / functions, but avoid contrived classes
- Make sure it works -- I will not be debugging the submission
- Structure your code **and** your assets

---

#### Report

- Clear structure
- Strong technical discussion
- Evidence of analysis
- Critique / reflection
- Concise -- long reports are a sign of poor preparation
- Avoid personal notes
- Don't leave till the last day -- bound to score low

---

#### Submission

- Follow the **instructions**, if incorrect format -- may not be accepted
- Don't submit files that aren't asked for, e.g. mac OS hidden files, `.git` directory or assets you didn't use
